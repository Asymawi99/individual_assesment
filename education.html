<!--Introduction-->

<h2 align="center"><u>MY EDUCATION JOURNEY</u></h2>
<p align="center" style="background-color: lightgrey; font-size: 18px;">For this page, I will explain my education journey from I was in primary school until today, continuing my Bachelor of Finance.</p> <hr>

<!--Explanation-->

<h2 >PRIMARY SCHOOL</h2>
<p style="background-color: lightgrey;">My childhood learning started at Sekolah Kebangsaan Kor. The school is placed near my house and it only take 10 minute if i walk to school. It is a rural primary school located in my village. So mostly of the students are from the same neighbourhood. I manage to finish my primary learning at the school and get 5A for the UPSR and it is still a shocked to me as i was not expecting for the result to be good.

<h2 >HIGH SCHOOL</h2>
<p style="background-color: lightgrey;">After finish primary school, i continue my study to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Mulong for my secondary learning. At there i meet new friends and make memories as i become a teenager. I'm a passive student and do not have any title during my high school day. I also do not participate in an school event as i don't like to be in public. For SPM i only manage to get 5A which is quite good for me based on my hardwork.

<h2 >DIPLOMA AND DEGREE</h2>
<p style="background-color: lightgrey;">Next, after successfully finished my study at the high school level, I have continued to further my study by taking a Diploma in Accountancy at Universiti Teknologi MARA Cawangan Kelantan Kampus Machang. During my study in UiTM Machang, I have make many memories with my new friends at there. At the university i do not belong to any club as i'm not a diligent person to do another extra work for me. In addition, i manage to finish my diploma after three years of study. And right now i'm continuing my study at UiTM Kota Bharu for my Bachelor Degree.
